## Introduction:

   ATM Machine simulation project is written in c++ . The project file contains main.cpp file. ATM Simulator System is based on a concept of managing cash transactions of a personal account. Before stepping into the dashboard a user has to pass through a login/pin system to get access, then the user can manage amount activities such as withdrawal, deposits, balance inquiry, and fund transfers. Thereâ€™s a quick cash feature from the withdrawal option. This ATM Simulator has exact the same features as that of real ATM.
